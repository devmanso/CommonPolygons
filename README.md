# CommonPolygons
a small header that helps you draw common polygons like Octogons, Hexagons, Pentagons etc, in your Raylib games

## how to use:
Simply include the header file into your project. The header depends on the math library for its use of trignomic functions, so be sure to include math.h too.

```
#include <math.h>
#include "raylib.h"
#include "rcommonpolygons.h"
```
